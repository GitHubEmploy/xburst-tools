=serial console=
  take off the cover of PCB, then you will send the "GND" and "TXD"
  and th TP74 is the "RXD", you can get serial output from those pins 
  you need a TTL <-> RS232 converter. here[1] is the serial PIN in the board.

=toolchain=
    $ git clone git://github.com/lindnermarek/openwrt-x-burst.git[2]
    $ git checkout --track -b x-burst origin/x-burst
    $ make menuconfig
         (select 'XBurst JZ47x0 [2.6]' in Target System
          for configure the u-boot in setp: 4)
    $ make
  we will get toolchain under /PATH/TO/openwrt-x-burst/staging_dir/
  toolchain-mipsel_gcc-4.1.2_uClibc-0.9.30.1/usr/bin

=xburst-tools (reflash tools)=
     you can get source in git://github.com/xiangfu/xburst-tools.git[3]

=u-boot=
    in openWRT menuconfig-->Target Images-->Build U-Boot bootloader -->
    U-Boot target board (NEW) --> input 'qi_lb60'
    here[4] is the u-boot github URL

=kernel(2.6.24)=
    here[5] is the kernel GIT URL.

=CPU Jz4740=
Jz4740 is a multimedia application processor targeted at mobile devices 
PMP. Incorporates the XBurst CPU core based on leading 
micro-architecture technology, this processor provides high integration, 
high performance and a low power consumption solution for embedded devices.

Boot up
The Jz4740 can be set to boot from NOR or NAND.
If booted from NAND, the CPU fetches the first page from NAND and uses the 
first 4 bytes on it to know how the NAND chip should be treated (16/8-bit 
bus, 2/3 row cycles). After that it copies the first 8kB from NAND and 
copies it to the I-Cache for execution.

Ingenic Media Extension Instruction Set
According to the MXU User Guide, the XBurst processor supports additional 
instructions called the Ingenic Media Extension Instruction Set (they 
call it an SIMD instruction set).

Excerpt from the PDF:
Processors (such as the Jz4740) have 60 extra SIMD commands used for the 
optimization of multimedia codecs such as MPEG4, H264, VC-1, RMVB, ... 
and other multimedia decoder algorithms that can be optimized using the MXU.

Image Processing Unit
The Jz4740 also has an IPU which has the following features:
    * Video frame resize
    * Color space conversion: 420/444/422 YUV to RGB convert 

=debian package=
1. run 'dh_make'
2. edit the file under 'debian' folder (create by 'dh_make')
3. run 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot' to create the deb package and source 
   package

[2] here is the web site
http://github.com/lindnermarek/openwrt-x-burst/commits/x-burst
     now we put the code in github.com
[3] in folder 'usbboot', here is the tar package and Debian package.
     http://cloud.github.com/downloads/xiangfu/xburst-tools/xburst-tools_0.0_200906.tar.gz

[4] http://github.com/xiangfu/qi-u-boot/tree
     this git repos have two branch [master] [pi]
     [master] is the v2009.06
     [pi] is 1.1.6 old version.(will detele laster)
[5] git://github.com/xiangfu/qi-kernel.git
    only one master branch in kernel git. so you can just
    'git clone' and 'make uImage' to get the kernel image
